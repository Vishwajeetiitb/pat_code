**node node failure**: one node is totally disconnected with respect to others. For example: node 12 having node node failure then it means  that if node 12 is visited then its idleness will not be updated with respect to another nodes. 

corner node: node 0

edge node: node 2

center node: node 12

# 1 car:

in comparison to proper connection, slight drop in idleness

>corner node is disconnected: behavior remains same

>edge node in disconnected: behavior remains same

>center node is disconnected: behavior remains same

# 2 cars:

in comparison to proper connection,identical and sinusodial in some cases

>corner node is disconnected: behavior remains same

>edge node in disconnected: behavior remains same

>center node is disconnected: behavior remains same

# 4 cars:

in comparison to proper connection,

>corner node is disconnected: asymmetrical behavior is noticed in few cases

>edge node in disconnected: variations in few cases

>center node is disconnected: symmtery behavior changes at the later end in few cases, rest almost same

# 6 cars:

in comparison to proper connection,

>corner node is disconnected: asymmetrical behavior is observed in few cases

>edge node in disconnected: asymmetrical behavior is observed with large variations

>center node is disconnected: similar behavior 

# 10 cars:

in comparison to proper connection,

>corner node is disconnected: similar behavior

>edge node in disconnected: similar behavior

>center node is disconnected: similar behavior
