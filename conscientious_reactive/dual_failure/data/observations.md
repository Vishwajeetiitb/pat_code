**dual failure**: both car node and node node communcation failure but on the same node. 

corner node: node 0

edge node: node 2

center node: node 12

# 1 car:

in comparison to proper connection, almost same

>corner node is disconnected: behavior changes slightly in few cases

>edge node in disconnected: randomness comes into play 

>center node is disconnected: behavior remains same

# 2 cars:

in comparison to proper connection, similar

>corner node is disconnected: asymmetrical behavior 

>edge node in disconnected: asymmetrical behavior 

>center node is disconnected: asymmetrical behavior

# 4 cars:

in comparison to proper connection, similar

>corner node is disconnected: asymmetrical behavior with large variations in few cases

>edge node in disconnected: almost identical

>center node is disconnected: almost identical

# 6 cars:

in comparison to proper connection, similar

>corner node is disconnected: asymmetrical with slight variations

>edge node in disconnected: very slight variation but almost identical

>center node is disconnected: very slight variation but almost identical

# 10 cars:

in comparison to proper connection, similar

>corner node is disconnected: very slight variation but almost identical

>edge node in disconnected: very slight variation but almost identical

>center node is disconnected: very slight variation but almost identical
